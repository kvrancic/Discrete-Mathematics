# Discrete Mathematics 1 Course Materials

## Course Overview

This repository is dedicated to the "Discrete Mathematics 1" course, part of the [FER3-EN] Computing study program for the 3rd semester at the University undergraduate level. The course covers fundamental aspects of discrete mathematics, including recursive relations, graph theory, trees, planarity, graph colourings, and directed graphs, emphasizing their applications in solving algorithmic problems.
